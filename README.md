# Mania Heaven #

A game made originally for an English presentation.

Mania Heaven is a 4K Mania Rhythm Game trying to offer new features that other games like Osu! or Quaver do not have (such as modcharts), and getting inspiration from other mania games such as NotITG.

Currently, Mania Heaven features:
- A keybindings menu (doesn't save, so you have to edit it every time you open the game)
- A functional editor that has:
  - Beatmap loading & saving
  - Adjustable step length
  - Sustain support

Currently, the plans we have for the future are:
- Finishing the actual gameplay
- Adding the ability to create modcharts and display custom sprites (via an event system)
- Fixing issues such as the game not being able to load files added after compiling
